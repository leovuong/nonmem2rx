The goal of nonmem2rx is to convert a NONMEM control stream to
`rxode2` for easy clinical trial simulation in R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of nonmem2rx from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nlmixr2/nonmem2rx")
```

## Example

Once `nonmem2rx` has been loaded, you simply type the location of the
nonmem control stream for the parser to start.  For example:

```{r example}
library(nonmem2rx)
mod <- nonmem2rx(system.file("run001.mod", package="nonmem2rx"))
mod 
```
